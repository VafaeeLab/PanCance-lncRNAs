Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA expression has been associated with many diseases, including cancer. Mounting evidence suggests lncRNAs to be involved in cancer initiation, progression, and me-tastasis. Thus, understanding the functional implications of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis can aid in developing novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Rich cancer datasets, documenting genomic and transcriptomic alterations together with advancement in bioinformatics tools, have presented an opportunity to perform pan-cancer analyses across different cancer types. This study is aimed at conducting a pan-cancer analysis of lncRNAs by performing differential expression and functional analyses between tumor and normal adjacent samples across eight cancer types. Among dysreg-ulated lncRNAs, seven were shared across all cancer types. We focused on three lncRNAs, found to be consistently dysregulated among tumors. It has been observed that these three lncRNAs of interest are interacting with a wide range of genes across different tissues, yet enriching sub-stantially similar biological processes, found to be implicated in cancer progression and prolif-eration.
